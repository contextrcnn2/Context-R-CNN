# Context-R-CNN
The repo consists of 4 files. First one is the loaded pre-trained model. other two are the library functions for the meta-arch. Last one is the architecture construction.

contributions: 
1. Nakula: data preprocessing and dataset uploading. Converted the sparse available dataset into a trainable one. Also, worked on the pre-trained model i.e PRE_TRAINED file.   Helped in the meta-architecture construction.
2. Piyush: worked on the codes of library functions of the short term memory bank i.e library1 file. Also, worked on the codes of attention module .
3. Rishabh: worked on the codes of library functions of the long term memory bank i.e library2 file.
4. Vaishnavi: worked on the meta-arch construction i.e ARCHITECTURE file. Used the library fucntions and imported faster RCNN to construct the arch.

* Everyone worked on the literature review part.
** we directly imported the faster RCNN model from tensorflow.

Future work:
In the next 10 days, we aim to re-train or fine tune the pre-trained model. also, aim to complete the meta arch. The meta arch. is not possible to train from scratch due to computational resources limitations. that's why we'll be doing the training part on pre-trained model as told by the mentors.
